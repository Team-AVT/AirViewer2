what went well.

-Good collaboration with the team.
-having meetings betweem mid sprints to discuss future stories and resolve problems.
-short sprints helped to achieve team performance and estimation.
-project deliverables were not set so, and adapted to changes in code without much disruption.

what could be improved

-Before picking any user story, picking each user story should have clear acceptance criteria.
-can improve on the concepts of literate programming.
-can improve on the concepts of programming by contract.
-Estimation of time required to complete the tasks/user-stories.


points of work accepted for the Sprint.

-for this sprint we have assigned a total of 13 points per user story and divided those points to individual tasks. 
-Based on the time taken to complete each individual task, each task has been assigned different points.
-In the sprint 1 all tasks have been completed and total points achieved.(for points and tasks refer https://github.com/Team-AVT/AirViewer2/blob/master/ProductBacklog.txt)
